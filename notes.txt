APP STATE
Refers to 'whats going on in you app at any given time'. For example,
angular state is in Factories and Services. In redux, state is stored
into one single 'tree structure', which is a structure formed out of
maps and arrays. State is pure data, nothing to do with the apps 
behavior. It's a good practice to have an idea of how the state tree
should look like before starting to code.


REDUX
the main advantage of using redux is that application state is immutable.
This means that application tree doesnt change. What is done is create
a completly new tree (which can inherit from the previous one). This
means that redux works purely on functions that take data and return data
which are predictable and will always return the same result if the same
data is entered.
It lets you walk back in time with no pain and return the app to
previous states with ease.


IMMUTABLE DATA:
the simplest example is a counter. it changes from 0 to 1 to 2, etc. 
however, a new number is assigned every time, since we cant mutate
a number to become another number (you cant use 42.setValue(43))
which means that the counter increment can be extracted to a pure
function that takes a number, adds one and returns a new number
the immutable library offers a full api to work easily with immutable
variables, objects, arrays, maps, etc (although is not required
to work with redux, you could simply use plain JS and avoid mutating
the objects).
