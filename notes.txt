APP STATE
Refers to 'whats going on in you app at any given time'. For example,
angular state is in Factories and Services. In redux, state is stored
into one single 'tree structure', which is a structure formed out of
maps and arrays. State is pure data, nothing to do with the apps 
behavior. It's a good practice to have an idea of how the state tree
should look like before starting to code.
